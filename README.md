# Github Releases

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/github_releases.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/github_releases)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/G5/github_releases.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/G5/github_releases)

Github Releases creates an endpoint that exposes an app's releases for use in
displaying a current version.

## Requirements

An app that utilizes Github's release feature

## Installation

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

   ```ruby
   gem 'github_releases'
   ```

2. And then execute:

   ```console
   bundle
   ```


3. Configure your app in a config/initializers/github_releases.rb initializer

   ```ruby
   GithubReleases.setup do |config|
      # configure your app's Github username
      config.username = 'g5search'
      # configure your app's Github repo name
      config.repo = 'g5-cxm'
   end

   ```

4. Install

   ```ruby
   rails g github_releases:install
   ```

   This mounts the engine at `/releases`.

## Usage

The engine exposes an endpoint at '/releases' that will list all of the app's
releases in json. '/releases/latest' will expose the latest release to use in
displaying your apps current version. You may also access any single release
by id '/releases/:id'.
